UNDERSTAND ALL CODE IF YOUR USING THEM



I now need to check where the ship is within the grids, if it is outside, then battleship_on_grid is false (DONE)

Fitting the ship to the grids may still need work (the ships can snap to the nearest grids, not to the row or col before it) (done)

Work on rect registering the collision with the ships and putting that in arrays to be stored (DONE)

Continue using target.truncate(0) for the other ships and use readFile to test them (done)

Create a scene before the game_PVP and after gamesetup2

Work on game_PvP

Find a way to convert the files into arrays or something (useable to put into the grids) (DONE)

Now check to see if the grid clicked on has a ship or not. (DONE)

MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AT LEAST 1 SHIP PLACED ON THE GRIDS FOR BOTH PLAYERS TO AVOID TESTING ERRORS

After the first couple of ships are destroyed, it becomes slow due to heavy calculations, maybe make it more efficient?
(After a set amount of shots, increase the speed of the plane)

Create an AI

Fix the left side of PvP (and make sure to copy it into AI) (done)

Also fixed the computer random generated ships (done)

Create leaderboard, work on getting aesthetics done

For FinalProjectLeaderboard, MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO MORE THAN 1 EXTRA BLANK LINE otherwise there will be an IndexError

Create Computer algorithm for shooting (maybe see if the computer hits, the computer shoots at nearby grids and stops at some point)

FIND OUT WHY AFTER PLAYER 1 FIRES A SECOND SHOT IN GAME PVP, LEFT_SIDE_RECTS IN GAME PLAYER 2 BECOMES EMPTY
OR FIND OUT WHY AFTER COMPUTER MISSES THE FIRST SHOT, LEFT_SIDE_RECTS BECOME EMPTY (Done)
